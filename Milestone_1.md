## Team Charter & Communication Plan

### Roles/Responsibilities

-   Due to a smaller team size and the potential for unbalanced work
    when assigning by category, tasks will be distributed by estimated
    time and effort of completion.\
-   At weekly meetings, the team will identify project needs, categorize
    tasks, and assign them.\
-   The Scrum Master assigns tasks based on individual strengths,
    workload balance, and preferences.

### Code of Conduct

-   Treat all group members with respect\
-   Complete assigned work on time\
-   Be responsive to communication\
-   Prioritize quality assurance

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Technology Stack & Development Environment

### Repository Setup

-   Branch Strategy: `main`, `dev`, `feature/<name>`

### Pull Request & Review Process

-   PRs require a peer review

### Build/Test Frameworks

-   Build: Python virtualenv\
-   Test: pytest

### Project Board Workflow

-   Columns: Backlog, To Do, In Progress, Review, Done\
-   Labels: bug, feature, documentation, AI-assisted

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## AI Tooling & Ethics Charter

### Acceptable AI Use

-   ChatGPT, Gemini, and Copilot may be used to create basic templates,
    review code, and assist in brainstorming.\
-   They may do simple but repetitive tasks.

### No-AI Zones

-   AI is not permitted to generate full code, handle VM
    fetch/decode/execute, opcode semantics, branching/overflow, or error
    handling.

### Provenance Plan

-   If AI code is used, add comments noting it was AI-generated.\
-   If AI is used in documentation, include a header stating AI
    involvement.

### Verification Plan

-   Weekly meeting reminders about AI expectations.\
-   Peer review contributions to ensure human involvement and quality
    assurance.
